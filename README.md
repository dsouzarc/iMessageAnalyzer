## iMessage Analyzer - Mac App

### Analyzes a user's iMessages while providing cool functionality

Analyzes a user's iMessage database (chat.db*) to understand a user and their friends' messaging habits by graphing (and calculating statistics) on those characteristics.

Adds some unique functionality from Messages.app that provides a better experience, including a refined search for messages.

*chat.db, where a user's messages are stored, can be found in 2 ways:

1. Where Messages.app (Apple's official Messages.app - iMessage for Mac) stores its data
2. Where the iPhone's chat.db database is stored after a backup to the computer

###### Newest features

- Double messages: See who sends the most followup messages; defined as successive messages sent by the same person within 3 minutes to 8 hours of the last message send time
- Conversation starters: See who starts the most conversations; defined as who messages first after 8 hours of the last message in the conversation


#### Current Features:

- Looks like iMessage
  + Contacts tableview on left side with contact name + profile picture
  + iMessages you sent are in blue on the right side of messages panel
    - Normal text messages you send are in green
  + iMessages you received are in gray on the left side of messages panel
  + Shows each message's date/time and read receipts

##### Unique from iMessage Features

- **Loads all of a user's messages** (as opposed to scrolling up forever to see the first few messages) 
    + Still memory efficient and quick for large conversations 
        - Tested on conversations with > 26,000 messages
        - Tested on total messages > 60,000
        - Barely uses 110MB of RAM
        - Minimal CPU usage

- Searching for text shows conversations 
    + With text that matches the conversation
    + With contact names/numbers/emails that match the text
    + Still (somehow) quicker than iMessage's search for conversations with text
    + Searched text is highlighted in yellow
    + Pressing enter moves to the next occurrence of that text

- View **messages sent and received on a certain date** for a conversation
    + Calendar view pops up and a date can be chosen to view all messages with that conversant on
    + Pressing "Reset to All" shows all messages with person

- Double clicking on contact in Contacts Tableview on the left shows
    + **Total number of messages you sent and received** in that conversation
    + Option to perform More Analysis

- More Analysis
    + Shows the following for All Time or on a specific date
        -  **Words organized by frequency/occurrence** for each person
            + Uses a Heap Data Structure I wrote
        - Total number of messages sent and received
        - Total number of words sent and received
        - Average word per message sent and received
        - Date selected from calendar view on bottom left
        - The actual messages sent and received
        - The number of double messages for each conversant: defined as two successive messages sent by the same person between 3 minutes and 8 hours of the last message sent
        - The number of times each conversant started a conversation: defined by who sends the first message at least 8 hours after the last message was sent/received

- **Graphs and charts**
  + **Line graph** of messages with that person since your first message
    - Allows for zooming in on specific date ranges
    - Data can be changed to show
        + Messages with that person compared to all other messages sent during that time period
        + Your sent vs received messages with that person over time 
        + Your sent vs received words with that person over time
  + **Pie Chart**
    - Sent messages vs received messages with person
    - Sent words vs received words with that person
    - Total messages with person vs all other messages in inbox
  + **Bar Chart**
    - Sent vs received messages per hour of day --> When y'all talk the most
    - Sent vs received words per hour of day --> When y'all talk the most
    - Percentage of total messages with person per hour of day vs percentage of all other messages with other people per hour of day --> When y'all talk the most in comparison to when you mainly talk to everyone else

#### Features in implementation:
- Statistics on actual messaging habits
    + Average reply time over the course of a day
- Autoreply based on replies to certain messages --> Machine Learning
